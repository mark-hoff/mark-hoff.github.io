    <p>Mark Hoff is Assistant Professor of Spanish in the Department of Hispanic Languages & Literatures at Queens College CUNY, where he teaches graduate and undergraduate courses in Spanish linguistics.</p>

<p></p>Mark specializes in morphosyntactic and pragmatic variation in Spanish, Portuguese, and other Romance languages.

Mark then moved to Columbus, Ohio and earned a PhD in Hispanic Linguistics at The Ohio State University (2019). His dissertation was entitled <i>Settledness and mood variation: A semantic-pragmatic analysis of Spanish future-framed adverbials</i>.</p>
