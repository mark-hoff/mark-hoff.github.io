    <h1>Research</h1>

<p>My work explores language variation at the intersection of morphosyntax and pragmatics, primarily in Spanish, Portuguese, and Italian (and occasionally English and French). I adopt quantitative, usage-based approaches (including, increasingly, Construction Grammar) to uncover and make sense of the contextual conditioning behind speakers' choices of linguistic forms.</p>

<p>Lately, I have a particular interest in the qualitative description of previously unstudied pragmatic markers common among young(ish) Argentines. These forms provide valuable insights into areas of study such as negation, polyphony, common ground, etc. </p>

      <div style="margin-left: 1.5em; font-size: 0.95em; color: #444;">
      Abstract: <i>Ah re</i> (lit. ‘ah, very’) is a pragmatic marker characteristic of Argentine Spanish that has been frequent in Millennial and Gen Z discourse for over two decades. Despite extensive commentary about its associations with the Flogger online subculture of the early 2000s (Suero 2020) and its perceived overuse, the pragmatic functions of <i>ah re</i> have received little scholarly attention. Although Kornfeld and Kuguel (2013) and De Luca (2019, 2021) document the use of <i>ah re</i> and <i>ah re que</i> to humorously reject a preceding utterance where <i>ah re</i> could perhaps be glossed as <i>just kidding</i> (see Haugh 2016), this does not account for the full range of <i>ah re</i> constructions or functions.
I build upon this prior work to offer the first in-depth sociopragmatic analysis of <i>ah re</i> constructions. Using posts from Twitter and BlueSky, I show that <i>ah re</i> also frequently appears in an <i>ah re + noun/adjective</i> construction and does not always straightforwardly negate a prior utterance but rather allows speakers to disalign in more nuanced ways. 
My qualitative analysis demonstrates that the seemingly disparate, highly context-dependent uses of all three <i>ah re</i> constructions can in fact be unified under the single overarching function of speaker distancing. I propose that <i>ah re</i> introduces a polyphonic effect (Ducrot 1984, García Negroni 2016, 2021), allowing speakers to introduce a second enunciative voice that distances them from the propositional content of a preceding utterance, produced either by themselves or an interlocutor. To explore the various motivations for this speaker distancing—which range from laughing off a self-deprecating remark, to softening an aggressive word choice, to hedging an accusation, to rejecting another’s opinion as ridiculous—I use Brown and Levinson’s (1987) framework of politeness and facework as a template according to which the sociopragmatic effects of <i>ah re</i> can be neatly categorized. I show that <i>ah re</i> is highly versatile, used to mitigate threats to both the speaker’s and hearer’s positive and negative faces. 
Thus, I conclude that <i>ah re</i>, rather than constituting an example of adolescent frivolity or young people “ruining” language, is best understood as a versatile pragmatic tool which allows speakers to strategically manage discourse alignment and social rapport.

      <li style="margin-bottom: 0.6em;"><b><i>Grazie di/per</i></b>: A web corpus analysis of the Italian <i>grazie di/per</i> alternation.</li>
      <div style="margin-left: 1.5em; font-size: 0.95em; color: #444;">
      Abstract: The prepositional variation of grazie di/per + complement ‘thanks for X’ is often acknowledged in Italian grammars but has not yet been adequately examined. I appeal to key tenets of Construction Grammar (Goldberg, 1995, 2019) to analyze 3,000 tokens of this construction from the Italian Web 2020 Corpus (Jakubíček et al., 2013). To fully probe the conditioning of di/per selection, I pair logistic regression of the entire dataset with a descriptive statistical analysis of various levels of constructional schematicity (Pijpops et al., 2021; Diessel, 2023) and frequent individual complements. Results confirm previous descriptions (Renzi et al., 1991; Viola, 2017) that per is now the majority variant and reveal that significant predictors of preposition selection include complement type (nominal, simple infinitive, compound infinitive), as well as complement complexity and quantity of intervening material (both measured in number of words). However, strong lexi-co-constructional effects are also observed, such that the older variant di remains strongly preferred in specific micro-constructions (e.g. grazie di tutto ‘thanks for everything’, grazie di esistere ‘thanks for existing’). These findings evince a complex case of variation which requires the joint consideration of both overall patterns and fine-grained constructional distinctions.
